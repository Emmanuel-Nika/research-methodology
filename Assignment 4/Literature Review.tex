\section*{Literature Review}
\paragraph{•}
Smartwatches or Android Wear are still a relatively new electronics category that eases human daily activities. Smartwatches are 
wearable-technology devices that maintain a relatively persistent wireless connection to your mobile device-usually a smart phone-and can receive notifications of incoming 
calls, texts, instant messages, social-network updates, and more, from that device. Some can also let you accept and conduct phone 
calls right on the watch. And even newer models (the Samsung Gear S, for one) can act as smart phones all on their own, without needing 
a paired phone nearby.
\paragraph{•}
Smartwatches, like smart phones, can also run apps, via your smart phone or right on the watch. These include health and fitness apps, 
apps that control functions such as music and camera on your phone, navigation apps, and more. 
Because smartwatches have open software platforms (at least so far), developers are coming up with new innovative apps that can increase 
the functionality of the devices. \cite{mangis}

\paragraph{•}
With Android Wear around and growing by the day, apps are being enhanced for the new OS, often adding features
that let them better stand alone from your smartphone. Examples include; \textit{Foursquare} which has easy navigation enabling
 a user to find the best food drink and activities in his/her local area, \textit{App in the Air} which gives you all your flight
  information right on your wrist including real-time boarding and flight status, \textit{Strava}, helps you track your runs and biking sessions,
  \textit{Wear Casts}, lets you download podcasts and stream from the watch and many more. \cite{nield}

\paragraph{•}
On the positive area, Android Wear has simple swipes and gestures to navigate menus and expand 
notifications, getting rid of buttons which slow down users. When a button is needed, they are big and only one is on the screen
at any one time making it a lot easier to hit while moving around. Tight integration with Android makes notifications useful - without any effort from developers, all apps can send notifications to Android Wear.
\paragraph{•}
Another advantage of Android Wear is granular control over which apps can notify users that is to say, the user can disable noisy apps 
which prevents notification overload. Notifications only show up when needed. This reduces clutter and keeps things simple. 
There is something really quite satisfying about archiving email or dismissing notifications from your wrist which Android Wear provides to users.
Menu transitions are smooth and fluid, no stutter or lag to be seen unlike some other smartwatches. Always-on screens with easily read watch faces make Android Wear some of the best smartwatches for actually telling the time.
\paragraph{•}
Finally, voice recognition is some of the best seen so far, often better than on an Android smartphone therefore, a
 quick Google search from the wrist works very well when trying to settle an argument.

\paragraph{•}
However not everything about the way it works and what it does is fantastic. After a solid week using it, 
here are some mixed reactions from users. Most advanced features need to be performed via voice, which means
 talking out loud in public. You will always look like a fool talking to yourself. Accessing installed apps
  requires launching via voice or digging through to the "Start" menu beneath the search app leading to a lot of unnecessary swiping and scrolling.
  
\paragraph{•}
A battery life of under two days is poor for a wearable gadget that is attempting to usurp a watch. There is 
no way to input text without speaking to the watches beyond simple yes or no replies yet babbling something into
 the microphone and hoping it gets it right can be tedious.
    
\paragraph{•} 
Finally, there's seemingly no way to insert punctuation or proper sentence formatting making you look lazy in your responses to messages.

\paragraph{•}
Despite the many failures of the Android Wear, possible fixes can also be made to enhance the smartwatches to further enhance human life.
Like Android on a smartphone, Android Wear supports third-party apps that can patch the holes in Google's software 
Wear Mini Launcher. This app adds a little draw that slides out from the top left with all your Android Wear apps, something that should have been baked into Google's software.
\textit{Minuum} and \textit{FlickKey}, two Android keyboard apps would be useful for text entry for short private messages.

\paragraph{•} 
Kinetic charging could help extend battery life. \cite{gibbs}
